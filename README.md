# Textsteganography Pytorch-Version

## Summary
#### This repository contains a Pytorch reimplementation for previously prevailing text steganography methods based on LSTM language model.
#### The codebase is heavily insprired by the [ADG-based steganography methods](https://github.com/Mhzzzzz/ADG-steganography)


## Steganography methods
#### Huffman-coding based method (HC.py)
#### Arithmetic-coding based method (AC.py)
#### Patient-huffman based method (P-HC.py)
#### ADG-based method (ADG.py)
#### The implementation of the GAN-APD text steganography ([2021 TDSC paper](10.1109/TDSC.2021.3079957)) is [here!](https://github.com/CAU-Tstega/text-steganography)

## Other Files
#### The code of training LSTM language model (train.py)
#### The code of architecture of LSTM Language model (lm.py)
#### The code of generating no-embedding text by well-trained LM with random sampling (Generated_Cover.py)
#### The code of Huffman algorithm (Huffman.py)
#### The other codes of these text-stegangography methods (utils.py)
